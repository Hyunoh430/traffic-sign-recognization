# Traffic Sign Dataset for Speed Limit Recognition

This repository contains a dataset of traffic signs categorized by speed limits. The dataset has been compiled from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive collection for traffic sign recognition tasks.

## Dataset Composition

The dataset is structured as follows:
- **30km, 50km, 60km, 70km, 80km:** These images are sourced from the [GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/gtsrb_dataset.html).
- **40km:** The images for this category are sourced from the [Traffic Sign Dataset - Classification](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5zyb2z2d3c/2).

### Folder Structure

The dataset is divided into the following folders based on speed limits:
- `30km`: Contains traffic sign images with a 30 km/h speed limit.
- `40km`: Contains traffic sign images with a 40 km/h speed limit.
- `50km`: Contains traffic sign images with a 50 km/h speed limit.
- `60km`: Contains traffic sign images with a 60 km/h speed limit.
- `70km`: Contains traffic sign images with a 70 km/h speed limit.
- `80km`: Contains traffic sign images with an 80 km/h speed limit.
