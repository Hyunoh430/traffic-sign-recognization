# CNN Dataset for Speed Limit Sign Classification

This repository contains a curated dataset of speed limit traffic signs intended for training and evaluating convolutional neural network (CNN) models for image classification tasks. The dataset exclusively includes speed limit signs, excluding other types such as pedestrian signals or stop signs, to maintain a focused and clean label space.
